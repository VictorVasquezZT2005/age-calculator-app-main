# Frontend Mentor - Age Calculator App

This is my solution to the **Age Calculator App** challenge from Frontend Mentor.
The goal of this challenge is to create an age calculator with strong validation, responsive design, and animated results.

## Overview

Users are able to:

* Enter their birth date (day/month/year) through a form.
* Get their exact age in **years, months, and days**.
* See validation errors if:

  * Any field is empty
  * The day is not between 1–31
  * The month is not between 1–12
  * The year is in the future
  * The date is invalid (e.g. 31/04/1991)
* View a fully responsive design across mobile and desktop.
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
* **Bonus:** Watch the age numbers animate from 0 to the calculated result.

* How to accurately calculate age using date differences.

## Future Improvements

* Add unit tests for the validation and date logic.
* Add smooth transitions for error messages.
* Implement a dark mode.
* Migrate the project to TypeScript for stronger type safety.
